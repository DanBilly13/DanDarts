## 🔧 Implementation Summary

### **1. FriendsService.swift - Withdraw Method**

**withdrawFriendRequest(requestId:)**
```swift
func withdrawFriendRequest(requestId: UUID) async throws {
    // Delete the friendship record
    try await supabaseService.client
        .from("friendships")
        .delete()
        .eq("id", value: requestId)
        .execute()
}
```

**Features:**
- Deletes the entire friendship record
- Uses friendship ID for precise targeting
- Async/await for clean error handling
- Identical implementation to deny (same DELETE operation)

**Why Identical to Deny:**
- Both delete the record completely
- Both are user-initiated cancellations
- Both allow sending new request later
- Code reusability and consistency

---

### **2. FriendRequestsView.swift - Withdraw Implementation**

**Withdraw Flow:**
```swift
private func withdrawRequest(_ request: FriendRequest) {
    processingRequestId = request.id
    
    Task {
        do {
            // 1. Delete the friendship record
            try await friendsService.withdrawFriendRequest(requestId: request.id)
            
            // 2. Light haptic feedback (subtle)
            UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()
            
            // 3. Remove from sent requests
            sentRequests.removeAll { $0.id == request.id }
            
            // 4. Clear processing state
            processingRequestId = nil
            
        } catch {
            // Error handling
            processingRequestId = nil
            UINotificationFeedbackGenerator().notificationOccurred(.error)
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **No success message** - Subtle, quiet action (like deny)
- **Light haptic** - `.light` instead of notification
- **Immediate removal** - No banner, just disappears
- **Updates sent requests** - Removes from sentRequests array

---

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### **Withdraw Request Flow:**

1. User taps gray Withdraw button (back arrow icon)
2. Button shows loading spinner
3. Button disabled
4. Request sent to Supabase
5. Friendship record deleted
6. Light haptic feedback (subtle tap)
7. Request card immediately removed from list
8. No success message shown
9. User can send new request to same person

**Subtle & Clean:**
- No banner or toast message
- Just a light haptic tap
- Card smoothly removed
- Can send new request immediately

### **Error Flow:**

1. User taps Withdraw button
2. Button shows loading spinner
3. Request fails
4. Error haptic feedback (notification)
5. Processing state cleared
6. Button returns to normal
7. User can retry

---

## 🗄️ Database Operation

### **SQL Query:**
```sql
DELETE FROM friendships
WHERE id = 'request-uuid';
```

### **Result:**
- Record completely removed from database
- No trace left in friendships table
- Addressee won't see request anymore
- Requester can send new request

### **Enables New Request:**
After withdrawal, the unique constraint `(requester_id, addressee_id)` is freed, allowing the user to send a new request to the same person.

---

## 🔄 Comparison: Deny vs Withdraw

Both operations are **identical** in implementation but serve different user perspectives:

| Feature | Deny (304) | Withdraw (305) |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| User | Addressee (receiver) | Requester (sender) |
| Action | DELETE record | DELETE record |
| Feedback | None (silent) | None (silent) |
| Haptic | Impact (light) | Impact (light) |
| Message | None | None |
| UI Update | Remove from received | Remove from sent |
| Result | Request disappears | Request disappears |
| Can Retry | Requester can send new | Can send new request |

**Why Same Implementation:**
- Both are user-initiated cancellations
- Both should be subtle and quiet
- Both delete the record completely
- Consistency in UX

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **SentRequestCard with Loading State:**

**Default State:**
```
[↶]  Gray circle, back arrow icon
```

**Processing State:**
```
[○]  Gray circle, gray spinner
```

**Disabled State:**
```
[↶]  Gray circle (dimmed), disabled
```

### **No Success Banner:**
Like deny, withdraw has no success message. The request simply disappears from the list with a subtle haptic tap.

**Why No Banner:**
- Withdrawing is a neutral action
- User initiated it, no confirmation needed
- Keeps UI clean and fast
- Consistent with deny behavior

---

## 🔄 SentRequestCard Integration

**Updated Component:**
```swift
struct SentRequestCard: View {
    let request: FriendRequest
    let isProcessing: Bool  // ✨ NEW
    let onWithdraw: () -> Void
    
    // Withdraw Button with loading state
    Button(action: onWithdraw) {
        ZStack {
            if isProcessing {
                ProgressView()
                    .tint(Color("TextSecondary"))
            } else {
                Image(systemName: "arrow.uturn.backward")
            }
        }
    }
    .disabled(isProcessing)
}
```

**Button States:**
- **Default:** Gray circle with back arrow
- **Processing:** Gray circle with gray spinner
- **Disabled:** Button disabled during processing

## 📝 Code Examples

### **Using the Service:**
```swift
let friendsService = FriendsService()

Task {
    do {
        try await friendsService.withdrawFriendRequest(
            requestId: requestUUID
        )
        print("✅ Friend request withdrawn (deleted)")
    } catch {
        print("❌ Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### **Complete Withdraw Flow:**
```swift
// In FriendRequestsView
private func withdrawRequest(_ request: FriendRequest) {
    processingRequestId = request.id
    
    Task {
        do {
            try await friendsService.withdrawFriendRequest(requestId: request.id)
            
            // Subtle haptic
            UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light).impactOccurred()
            
            // Update UI
            sentRequests.removeAll { $0.id == request.id }
            processingRequestId = nil
        } catch {
            processingRequestId = nil
            UINotificationFeedbackGenerator().notificationOccurred(.error)
        }
    }
}
```

## 🔄 Search Results Update

After withdrawing a request, the user can immediately send a new request:

**Before Withdraw:**
- FriendSearchView shows "Request Sent" (paperplane icon, disabled)
- Button disabled, gray background

**After Withdraw:**
- Record deleted from database
- Unique constraint freed
- User can search for same person
- "Send Request" button enabled again (blue plus icon)

**Implementation Note:**
The search results update automatically because:
1. Withdraw deletes the record
2. Next time user searches, no pending request exists
3. Button shows default "Send Request" state
4. User can send new request

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Task 306: Implement Block User**
- Create blockUser(userId: UUID) method
- If existing friendship: update status to 'blocked'
- If no friendship: create record with status 'blocked'
- Remove user from friends list if currently friends
- Add "Block" option in friend profile view
- Add confirmation alert ("Block [Name]?")
- Block prevents future friend requests
- Show feedback ("User blocked")
- Add haptic feedback (warning)

**Task 307-308: Block List & Badges**
- Create BlockedUsersView
- Badge indicators on Friends tab
- Navigation to requests view
