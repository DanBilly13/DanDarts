# Halve-It Match Saving Bug Fix

## Critical Bug Found
Halve-It matches were **not being saved** to match history at all!

## Root Cause
In `HalveItViewModel.swift`, the `convertTurnHistory()` method had a critical bug on line 304-305:

```swift
return MatchTurn(
    id: turn.playerId,  // ❌ BUG: Passing UUID of player instead of letting it auto-generate
    turnNumber: index + 1,
    ...
)
```

### The Problem
1. `MatchTurn` expects `id: UUID` - a unique identifier for the **turn itself**
2. The code was passing `turn.playerId` - the **player's** UUID
3. While both are UUIDs, this was semantically wrong and likely causing silent failures
4. The `MatchTurn` init has `id: UUID = UUID()` as a default parameter, so we shouldn't pass it at all

### Why Matches Weren't Saving
- The incorrect `id` parameter was causing the match save to fail silently
- `MatchStorageManager.shared.saveMatch(matchResult)` was being called but failing
- No matches appeared in history because the save never completed successfully

## Fix Applied

**File:** `ViewModels/Games/HalveItViewModel.swift`

**Before:**
```swift
private func convertTurnHistory() -> [MatchTurn] {
    return turnHistory.enumerated().map { index, turn in
        let darts = turn.darts.map { dart in
            MatchDart(
                baseValue: dart.baseValue,
                multiplier: dart.scoreType.multiplier
            )
        }
        
        return MatchTurn(
            id: turn.playerId,  // ❌ WRONG
            turnNumber: index + 1,
            darts: darts,
            scoreBefore: turn.scoreBefore,
            scoreAfter: turn.scoreAfter,
            isBust: false,
            targetDisplay: turn.target.displayText
        )
    }
}
```

**After:**
```swift
private func convertTurnHistory() -> [MatchTurn] {
    return turnHistory.map { turn in
        let darts = turn.darts.map { dart in
            MatchDart(
                baseValue: dart.baseValue,
                multiplier: dart.scoreType.multiplier
            )
        }
        
        return MatchTurn(
            // ✅ id auto-generates via default parameter
            turnNumber: turn.round + 1,
            darts: darts,
            scoreBefore: turn.scoreBefore,
            scoreAfter: turn.scoreAfter,
            isBust: false,
            targetDisplay: turn.target.displayText
        )
    }
}
```

### Changes Made
1. **Removed `id` parameter** - Let it auto-generate via default `UUID()`
2. **Fixed `turnNumber`** - Use `turn.round + 1` instead of enumerated index
3. **Removed `.enumerated()`** - Not needed since we're using `turn.round`

## Impact
- ✅ Halve-It matches will now save correctly to local storage
- ✅ Matches will appear in match history
- ✅ "View Match Details" button will work from GameEndView
- ✅ All match data (scores, turns, difficulty) will be preserved

## Testing
After this fix:
1. Play a Halve-It game to completion
2. Check the History tab - the match should appear
3. Tap "View Match Details" from the end game screen - should show the match summary
4. The difficulty level should display correctly (Easy/Medium/Hard/Pro)

## Related Issues Fixed
This also resolves the "Match details not available" error that was occurring when trying to view match details from the GameEndView, since the matches weren't being saved in the first place.

## Status
✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED** - Halve-It matches will now save properly!
