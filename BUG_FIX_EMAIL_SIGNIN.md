# Bug Fix: Email Sign-In Not Working

## Issue
When signing in using email and password, nothing works - users cannot access the app after entering valid credentials.

## Root Cause
The `needsProfileSetup` flag was not being reset to `false` when existing users signed in. This caused `ContentView` to show `ProfileSetupView` instead of `MainTabView` even though the user was authenticated.

### What Was Happening:
1. User signs in with email/password
2. `AuthService.signIn()` successfully authenticates and sets `currentUser`
3. `updateAuthenticationState()` sets `isAuthenticated = true`
4. BUT `needsProfileSetup` remained at its previous value (could be `true` or `false`)
5. If `needsProfileSetup` was `true`, `ContentView` would show `ProfileSetupView` instead of `MainTabView`
6. Result: User appears to be stuck, unable to access the app

## Solution
Modified `updateAuthenticationState()` to explicitly set `needsProfileSetup = false` when authenticating. This ensures that:
- New users signing up: `needsProfileSetup = true` (set explicitly in `signUp()`)
- Existing users signing in: `needsProfileSetup = false` (set by `updateAuthenticationState()`)
- Users completing profile setup: `needsProfileSetup = false` (set by `completeProfileSetup()`)

## Files Modified

### AuthService.swift
**Modified `updateAuthenticationState()`:**
```swift
private func updateAuthenticationState() {
    isAuthenticated = currentUser != nil
    needsProfileSetup = false // Ensure profile setup flag is cleared when authenticating
}
```

**Modified `clearAuthenticationState()`:**
```swift
private func clearAuthenticationState() {
    currentUser = nil
    isAuthenticated = false
    needsProfileSetup = false // Clear profile setup flag on sign out
}
```

## Flow After Fix

### Sign In (Existing User):
1. User enters email/password
2. `signIn()` authenticates with Supabase
3. Fetches user profile from database
4. Sets `currentUser`
5. Calls `updateAuthenticationState()` which sets:
   - `isAuthenticated = true`
   - `needsProfileSetup = false` ✅
6. `ContentView` shows `MainTabView` ✅

### Sign Up (New User):
1. User completes signup
2. `signUp()` creates account
3. Sets `currentUser` and `needsProfileSetup = true`
4. Does NOT call `updateAuthenticationState()` yet
5. `ContentView` shows `ProfileSetupView`
6. After profile setup, `updateAuthenticationState()` is called
7. `ContentView` shows `MainTabView`

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Email sign-in with existing account → Navigate to MainTabView
- [x] Email sign-up with new account → Show ProfileSetupView
- [x] Complete profile setup → Navigate to MainTabView
- [x] Skip profile setup → Navigate to MainTabView
- [x] Google sign-in (existing) → Navigate to MainTabView
- [x] Google sign-in (new) → Show ProfileSetupView
- [x] Sign out → Clear all state properly

## Related Bug Fixes
This fix complements the previous "Profile Setup Flash" bug fix. Together they ensure:
1. New users see ProfileSetupView without flash
2. Existing users go directly to MainTabView
3. All authentication states are properly managed
