# Halve-It Difficulty Level Display Fix

## Problem
The difficulty level displayed in match history views (HalveItMatchDetailView and MatchSummarySheetView) was **calculated** based on the number of rounds played instead of showing the **actual difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard, Pro) that the player selected during game setup.

## Root Cause
The `MatchResult` model didn't have a field to store game-specific metadata like the Halve-It difficulty level. The views were trying to infer the difficulty by calculating it from the number of rounds, which was incorrect.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Metadata Field to MatchResult Model
**File:** `Models/MatchResult.swift`

- Added optional `metadata: [String: String]?` field to store game-specific data
- Updated `init()` to accept metadata parameter (default: nil)
- Updated `hash()` and `==` implementations to include metadata
- **Backwards compatible:** Old matches without metadata will still work

### 2. Store Difficulty When Saving Halve-It Matches
**File:** `ViewModels/Games/HalveItViewModel.swift`

- Modified `saveMatchResult()` to include difficulty in metadata:
  ```swift
  metadata: ["difficulty": difficulty.rawValue]
  ```
- The difficulty enum values are: "easy", "medium", "hard", "pro"

### 3. Display Actual Difficulty in Match History
**Files:** 
- `Views/History/HalveItMatchDetailView.swift`
- `Views/History/MatchSummarySheetView.swift`

**Before:**
```swift
private var halveItLevel: Int {
    guard let firstPlayer = match.players.first else { return 1 }
    let roundCount = firstPlayer.turns.count
    return min((roundCount + 5) / 6, 3) // Calculated incorrectly
}
```

**After:**
```swift
private var halveItLevel: String {
    guard let difficulty = match.metadata?["difficulty"] else {
        return "Easy" // Default fallback for old matches
    }
    // Capitalize first letter for display
    return difficulty.prefix(1).uppercased() + difficulty.dropFirst()
}
```

## Display Format
The difficulty now shows as:
- **"Halve-It - Easy"**
- **"Halve-It - Medium"**
- **"Halve-It - Hard"**
- **"Halve-It - Pro"**

## Backwards Compatibility
- Old matches without metadata will default to "Easy"
- All existing functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes to the data model

## Files Modified
1. `/Models/MatchResult.swift` - Added metadata field
2. `/ViewModels/Games/HalveItViewModel.swift` - Store difficulty in metadata
3. `/Views/History/HalveItMatchDetailView.swift` - Display actual difficulty
4. `/Views/History/MatchSummarySheetView.swift` - Display actual difficulty

## Testing
After this fix:
1. ✅ New Halve-It matches will save the selected difficulty
2. ✅ Match history will show the correct difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard/Pro)
3. ✅ Old matches will default to "Easy" gracefully
4. ✅ The title in both detail view and summary sheet will match the player's selection

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - The difficulty level now correctly reflects the player's choice during game setup.
