# English Cricket
**Subtitle:** Bat and Bowl with Darts  
**Players Required:** 2 or more

English Cricket features a **batter** and a **bowler**, similar to traditional cricket. The game can be played one-on-one or with teams.

The batting team aims to score as many points as possible by hitting the scoring numbers (15–20 and bullseye). The bowling team aims for the **bullseye** — an outer bullseye is worth one wicket, a bullseye two wickets.

Once the bowling team reaches ten wickets, that marks the end of the batting team’s innings. Then teams switch roles. The team with the highest score after both have batted wins.
