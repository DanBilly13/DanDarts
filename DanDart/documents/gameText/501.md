# 501
**Subtitle:** The Professional Standard  
**Players Required:** 2 or more

Players start with 501 points and take turns throwing three darts. Each turn’s total is subtracted from the player’s score. The objective is to reach exactly zero, with the final dart landing on a **double**. If a player scores below zero or one, they bust and return to their previous score. The first player to finish on zero wins. This is the format used in most professional darts tournaments.
