# Knockout
**Subtitle:** Beat the Previous Player or Lose a Life  
**Players Required:** 2 or more

Determine the throwing order by throwing one dart each at the bullseye â€” closest goes first. Before the game begins, decide how many lives each player gets.

The first player throws three darts to set a score. The next player must beat that score, or they lose a life. Continue in order, with each player trying to outscore the last. The winner is the final player left with one or more lives remaining.
