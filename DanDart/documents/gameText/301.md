# 301
**Subtitle:** A Classic Countdown Game  
**Players Required:** 2 or more

Each player starts with a score of 301. Players take turns throwing three darts per round and subtract the total from their score. The goal is to reach exactly zero, finishing on a **double**. If a score goes below zero or ends on one, the turn is a **bust** and the score reverts to its previous total. The first player to reach exactly zero wins.
