# Killer
**Subtitle:** Target Others, Protect Yourself  
**Players Required:** 2 or more

To start, each player throws one dart to determine their number (1–20). No two players can share the same number. If you land on an already-chosen number, keep throwing until you get a free one.

Decide how many lives each player starts with. Players must first hit their own number’s **double** to become a **Killer**. Once a Killer, hitting another player’s number’s double removes one of their lives.

You can lose your own lives by accidentally hitting your number while attacking others. To regain lives, hit your own number again. The last player with one or more lives wins.
