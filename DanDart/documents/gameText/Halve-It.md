# Halve-It
**Subtitle:** Accuracy Under Pressure  
**Players Required:** 2 or more

A popular darts game that can be played with a large group. Select six different targets on the dartboard, and each player takes turns trying to hit those targets.

For every target hit, add that score to your total. For example, if the first target is single 20 and you hit two single 20s, you add 40 points. If you fail to hit a target with three darts, you must **halve your total score**. The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.

Make the game easier or harder depending on your group. Easier: aim for singles or segments. Harder: target bullseye, doubles, or trebles.
