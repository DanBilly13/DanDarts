# Bug Fix: Google Sign-In Not Working

## Issue
The "Sign in with Google" button in SignInView doesn't work - nothing happens when users tap it.

## Root Cause
The Google sign-in button in `SignInView.swift` had a placeholder `// TODO: Implement Google sign in` comment and wasn't actually calling the `AuthService.signInWithGoogle()` method. The button action was empty.

### What Was Missing:
```swift
// Before (line 150-152):
Button(action: {
    // TODO: Implement Google sign in
}) {
```

The button was rendered but had no functionality implemented.

## Solution
Implemented the Google sign-in button action to call `authService.signInWithGoogle()` and added proper loading states and error handling.

## Changes Made

### SignInView.swift

**1. Updated Button Action:**
```swift
Button(action: {
    Task {
        await signInWithGoogle()
    }
}) {
```

**2. Added Loading State to Button UI:**
```swift
HStack(spacing: 12) {
    if isLoading {
        ProgressView()
            .progressViewStyle(CircularProgressViewStyle(tint: Color("TextPrimary")))
            .scaleEffect(0.8)
    } else {
        Image(systemName: "globe")
            .font(.system(size: 16, weight: .medium))
    }
    
    Text(isLoading ? "Signing in with Google..." : "Sign in with Google")
        .font(.system(size: 17, weight: .semibold))
}
```

**3. Added Disabled State:**
```swift
.disabled(isLoading)
```

**4. Implemented signInWithGoogle() Method:**
```swift
/// Sign in with Google OAuth
private func signInWithGoogle() async {
    // Clear previous error
    errorMessage = ""
    
    // Set loading state
    isLoading = true
    
    do {
        // Call AuthService Google OAuth
        let isNewUser = try await authService.signInWithGoogle()
        
        // Dismiss SignInView
        // If new user: ContentView will show ProfileSetupView
        // If existing user: ContentView will show MainTabView
        dismiss()
        
    } catch let error as AuthError {
        // Handle specific OAuth errors
        switch error {
        case .oauthCancelled:
            // Don't show error for cancelled OAuth
            break
        case .oauthFailed:
            errorMessage = "Google sign in failed. Please try again"
        case .networkError:
            errorMessage = "Network error. Please check your connection and try again"
        default:
            errorMessage = "Failed to sign in with Google. Please try again"
        }
    } catch {
        errorMessage = "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again"
    }
    
    // Reset loading state
    isLoading = false
}
```

## Flow After Fix

### Google Sign-In (Existing User):
1. User taps "Sign in with Google"
2. Button shows loading spinner
3. Google OAuth flow opens
4. User authenticates with Google
5. `AuthService.signInWithGoogle()` checks if user exists
6. Existing user found → Sets `isAuthenticated = true`, `needsProfileSetup = false`
7. SignInView dismisses
8. ContentView shows MainTabView ✅

### Google Sign-In (New User):
1. User taps "Sign in with Google"
2. Button shows loading spinner
3. Google OAuth flow opens
4. User authenticates with Google
5. `AuthService.signInWithGoogle()` creates new user profile
6. Sets `needsProfileSetup = true` (NOT authenticated yet)
7. SignInView dismisses
8. ContentView shows ProfileSetupView ✅
9. After profile setup → MainTabView

### Error Handling:
- **OAuth Cancelled:** No error message (user cancelled intentionally)
- **OAuth Failed:** "Google sign in failed. Please try again"
- **Network Error:** "Network error. Please check your connection and try again"
- **Other Errors:** "Failed to sign in with Google. Please try again"

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Google sign-in with existing account → Navigate to MainTabView
- [ ] Google sign-in with new account → Show ProfileSetupView
- [ ] Cancel Google OAuth → No error shown, stay on SignInView
- [ ] Network error during OAuth → Show error message
- [ ] Button shows loading state during OAuth
- [ ] Button is disabled during loading

## Files Modified
- **SignInView.swift** - Implemented Google sign-in button action and signInWithGoogle() method
